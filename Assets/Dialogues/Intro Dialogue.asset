    MessageText: "So I just sat there contemplating my Life choices and bam, it hit
      me! I'm stuck! I'm going nowhere! \r\nI mean, I get up every morning, go to
      work, get home, play with the kids and go to sleep, but is that actually doing
      something? \r\nAm I changing anything in the grand scheme of things by living
      the life the way I do? \r\nDo the people around me think about me more than
      just inn passing? \r\nDoes anything I'm doing actually matter? \r\nNo! \r\nI
      mean, it doesn't have to be that way! I'm a smart guy, I work out, that's gotta
      count for something right? \r\nI could be the change the world needs, it's
      superhero, throwing of its blanket of apathy and disinterest! \r\nBut instead
      I just trudge along like everyone else. Having my dreams buried unter the daily
      slog of work and mortgage payments long ago... \r\n\r\nBut no more! I'm ripping
      off my chains, escaping my prison and I will show everyone what I got! \r\nTrust
      me, the world will be taken by storm from me. I will take out it's rotten parts
      and build it new out of it's ashes! \r\nI will rip off it's shackles of convenience!
      \r\nAnd when I walk down the street everyone will look at me in wonder. \r\nWhere
      did this man come from? And why is he so handsome? \r\nAnd everyone will be
      in awe of the man with the name off.... "
